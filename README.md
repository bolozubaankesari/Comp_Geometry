# Comp_Geometry_SoC
This repository contains the work of Advait Risbud(200110089).  The file SoC.jpynb is the jupyter notebook with all the code for the project. Plan.jpynb contains the guidelines under which I had worked post some literature review of Computational Geometry and Data Structures and Algorithms, learning python libraries such as numpy and scipy. 



1. The main code file begins with the documentation of some basic terms in complexity theory and computing. The literature review of computational geometry and DSA has not been thoroughly documented because of their ubiquitous nature. I then(under guidance of my mentor) delved into image processing and computer vision. 
2. Covered basics of images and their manipulation using numpy.
3. Operations on images.
4. Using OpenCV.
5. Algorithms for thresholding and interpolation.
6. Filters for images.
7. Point Clouds.
